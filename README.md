# 🐍 Python Learning Roadmap Repository

Welcome to the **Step-by-Step Python Learning** repository!  
This repository contains notes, exercises, and mini-projects organized by learning stages — from the basics to building real-world Python applications. It's perfect for self-learners or anyone who wants a structured way to learn Python.

### 🗺️ Roadmap Pembelajaran Python

The learning journey is divided into several stages, from beginner to advanced, with practice projects to reinforce each concept.

### Stage 1: Basic Python ✅ (_Completed_)

> The essential foundations of Python that every learner should master first.

-   [x] Variable & Data Type
-   [x] Input / Output
-   [x] Conditional Statement (`if`)
-   [x] Loops (`for`, `while`)
-   [x] Functions
-   [x] Lists & Dictionaries
-   [x] **Mini CLI Project**

📁 Folder: [`01-basic-python`](/01-basic-python/)

### Stage 2: Intermediate Python

> This stage introduces more advanced Python features with hands-on practice.

-   [x] List Comprehension
-   [x] Tuples & Sets
-   [x] Functions with `*args` and `**kwargs`
-   [ ] Exception Handling (`try`, `except`)
-   [ ] Modularization (`import`, modules)
-   [ ] File I/O (reading/writing `.txt` files)
-   [ ] Simple Python project folder structure
-   [ ] **Practice Projects:** File manager, CLI apps, logic calculator, etc.

### Stage 3: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

> Learn the OOP paradigm, a key concept in software development.

-   [ ] Classes & Objects
-   [ ] Constructors (`__init__`)
-   [ ] Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
-   [ ] **OOP-Based Mini Project**

📁 Folder: [`03-oop-python`](/03-oop-python/)

### Stage 4: Advanced Python

> Advanced language features and writing more "Pythonic" code.

-   [ ] Virtual Environments (`venv`, `pip`)
-   [ ] Testing (unit tests, `pytest`)
-   [ ] Lambda Functions, `map()` / `filter()` / `reduce()`
-   [ ] Decorators & Generators
-   [ ] Context Managers (`with`)
-   [ ] Logging & Debugging

### Stage 5: Building Real Python Applications

> Choose your path based on your interests or career goals:

-   [ ] Web Development: Flask, Django
-   [ ] Data Science: Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy
-   [ ] Automation / Scripting: Selenium, cron
-   [ ] API Development: Flask REST, FastAPI
-   [ ] Desktop Applications: Tkinter, PyQt
-   [ ] AI / Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
